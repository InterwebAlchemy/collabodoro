# Collabodoro

A collaborative, real-time [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) timer for virtual coworking.

**Note**: The default timer uses a 25 minute work/5 minute break configuration. This demo was just recorded with a shorter time configuration to more easily show the transition from work to rest.

Host a Collabodoro session or join another user's session to get synced up with their current pomodoro session and take your rest breaks at the same time.

**Note**: Connecting to Peer Collabodoro sessions is **coming soon**.
